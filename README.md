# Spotify_tts
**Reads aloud the name of the music playing on spotify using AI or espeak**

# Main points:
* Linux only, needs to have [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) installed
* 2 modes available, either poor quality speech using `espeak`, or high quality using [TransformerTTS](https://github.com/as-ideas/TransformerTTS)
* Contributions welcome.

# Usage:
* `git clone https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/Spotify_tts/`
* `cd Spotify_tts`
* `pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt` **optionnal, only if you want to use AI powered TTS**
* `cd Spotify_tts && python3 ./Spotify_tts.py`
